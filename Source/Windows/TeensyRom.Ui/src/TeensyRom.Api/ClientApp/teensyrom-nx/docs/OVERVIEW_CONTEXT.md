# TeensyROM Angular Nx Monorepo Context & Architecture

## Project Overview

This is a **hybrid .NET/Angular application** for TeensyROM device management and media playback. The backend is a .NET 9 Web API using **RadEndpoints** for minimal APIs and **MediatR** for CQRS patterns. The frontend is an **Angular 19 application** built with **Nx monorepo** architecture using **Clean Architecture** principles.

### Technology Stack

**Backend (.NET API)**:

- .NET 9 with RadEndpoints minimal APIs
- MediatR for CQRS patterns
- SignalR for real-time communication
- Scalar API documentation (replaces Swagger)

**Frontend (Angular/Nx)**:

- Angular 19 with standalone components
- Nx workspace with Clean Architecture library organization
- NgRx Signal Store for state management
- Angular Material UI components
- Vitest for unit testing, Cypress for E2E

## Clean Architecture Design

This application follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns across distinct layers:

### Architecture Layers

1. **Domain Layer** (`libs/domain`) - Pure business logic, contracts, and models
2. **Application Layer** (`libs/application`) - Use cases, state management, and application services  
3. **Infrastructure Layer** (`libs/infrastructure`) - External concerns (HTTP clients, SignalR, etc.)
4. **Presentation Layer** (`libs/features`, `libs/ui`) - UI components and user interactions

### Dependency Rules

- **Domain** has no dependencies (pure TypeScript)
- **Application** depends only on Domain
- **Infrastructure** depends on Domain (implements contracts)
- **Presentation** depends on Application and Domain (not Infrastructure directly)

### Architecture Goals

- Enforce strict dependency boundaries using Clean Architecture principles
- Keep domain logic pure and framework-agnostic (no Angular dependencies in domain)
- Implement dependency inversion with contracts and abstract implementations
- Maintain testable, modular code with clear separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection to wire infrastructure implementations to domain contracts

## Clean Architecture Layer Responsibilities

### 1. Domain Layer (`libs/domain`) - Pure Business Logic

**Purpose**: Contains the core business rules, entities, and contracts that define the application's behavior

- **Models**: Shared domain entities and value objects representing core business concepts (located in `models/` folder)
- **Contracts**: Pure TypeScript interfaces defining service contracts (no implementations)
- **Business Logic**: Pure domain logic and business rules (framework-agnostic)
- **No Dependencies**: Zero external dependencies - pure TypeScript only

**Shared Model Structure**:
All domain models are located in the shared `models/` folder for universal access:
- **Device Models**: `Device`, `DeviceStorage`
- **Storage Models**: `DirectoryItem`, `FileItem`, `ViewableItemImage`, `FileItemType`, `StorageType`, `StorageDirectory`
- **Individual Files**: Each interface/enum is in its own file for better maintainability and tree-shaking

**Contract Examples**:
- `IDeviceService` contract defining device operations
- `IStorageService` contract defining file system operations  
- Domain validation rules and business logic

### 2. Application Layer (`libs/application`) - Use Cases & State

**Purpose**: Orchestrates domain objects to perform application use cases and manages application state

- **State Management**: NgRx Signal Stores for reactive application state
- **Use Case Orchestration**: Coordinates domain services to fulfill user requests
- **Application Services**: High-level application logic and workflows
- **Depends Only on Domain**: Uses domain contracts, never infrastructure implementations

**Examples**:
- Device state management with connection workflows
- Storage state management with navigation and file operations
- Application-level orchestration of domain services
- State synchronization and caching logic

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (`libs/infrastructure`) - External Concerns

**Purpose**: Implements domain contracts using external technologies and frameworks

- **Service Implementations**: Concrete implementations of domain service contracts
- **HTTP Clients**: API communication using generated OpenAPI clients
- **SignalR Integration**: Real-time communication implementations
- **Framework Dependencies**: Angular-specific and external library integrations

**Examples**:
- `DeviceService` implementing `IDeviceService` using HTTP and SignalR
- `StorageService` implementing `IStorageService` using HTTP API
- Data mapping between API DTOs and domain models
- External service integrations and I/O operations

### 4. Presentation Layer (`libs/features`, `libs/ui`) - User Interface

**Purpose**: Handles user interactions and presents data to users

- **Feature Components**: Smart components that coordinate application state and user actions
- **UI Components**: Presentational components for displaying data and capturing input
- **User Workflows**: Complete user interaction flows and navigation
- **Depends on Application**: Uses application state and services (not infrastructure directly)

## Clean Architecture Development Patterns & Standards

### Clean Architecture Principles

- **Dependency Inversion**: Infrastructure implements domain contracts, not the reverse
- **Layer Isolation**: Each layer only depends on inner layers (Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure/Presentation)
- **Framework Independence**: Domain layer has zero framework dependencies (pure TypeScript)
- **Testability**: Mock domain contracts for unit tests, not concrete implementations

### Angular 19 Modern Patterns

- **Standalone Components**: All components use standalone architecture with direct imports
- **Modern Control Flow**: Uses `@if`, `@for`, `@switch` instead of structural directives
- **Signal-based APIs**: Prefers `input()` and `output()` over `@Input()` and `@Output()`
- **Signal State Management**: NgRx Signal Store for reactive state with computed selectors

### Domain Layer Standards

- **Pure TypeScript**: No Angular, RxJS, or external dependencies in domain layer
- **Contracts First**: Define service interfaces before implementations
- **Domain Models**: Rich domain entities with business logic (when applicable)
- **Framework Agnostic**: Domain logic should work in any TypeScript environment
- **Model Organization**: Currently domain-specific (`device/models/`, `storage/models/`), planned refactor to shared `models/` folder
- **Cross-Domain Reuse**: Models designed for reusability across multiple domain contracts

### Application Layer Patterns

- **Use Case Orchestration**: Coordinate domain services to fulfill business requirements
- **State Management**: NgRx Signal Store managing application state and side effects
- **Dependency on Contracts**: Import domain contracts, never infrastructure implementations
- **Business Workflows**: High-level application logic and user journey orchestration

### Infrastructure Layer Implementation

- **Contract Implementation**: Concrete classes implementing domain service contracts
- **External Integration**: HTTP clients, SignalR, file system, database access
- **Data Mapping**: Transform external data (API DTOs) to/from domain models
- **Framework Specific**: Angular services, RxJS, HTTP client integrations

### UI Layer Principles

- **Pure Presentation**: UI components contain no business logic or state management
- **Configurable**: Components accept inputs for all visual and behavioral variations
- **Composable**: Small, focused components that can be combined for complex UIs
- **Accessible**: Built-in accessibility features and ARIA support
- **Themeable**: Consistent design system with dark/light theme support
- **Framework Agnostic Logic**: Theme and styling logic separated from Angular-specific code

**📖 Documentation**: See [COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md](COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md) for complete component catalog and [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md) for global styles and utility classes

### Dependency Injection Patterns

- **Provider Configuration**: Configure DI to bind domain contracts to infrastructure implementations
- **Injection Tokens**: Use Angular injection tokens for loose coupling
- **Service Registration**: Register services at appropriate levels (root, feature, component)
- **Mock Friendly**: Easy to swap implementations for testing

### API Client Integration

- **Generated Clients**: Build-time OpenAPI generation from .NET API (no running server required)
- **Post-processing**: Automatic renaming of `*Service` to `*ApiService` for clarity  
- **Infrastructure Wrapped**: Promise-based TypeScript client wrapped with RxJS in infrastructure
- **Domain Mapping**: Always map through infrastructure mappers, never import API types directly
- **Clean Architecture Compliance**: API clients consumed only by infrastructure layer services

**📖 Documentation**: See [API_CLIENT_GENERATION.md](API_CLIENT_GENERATION.md) for complete client regeneration guide

**Integration Pattern**:
```typescript
// ✅ Infrastructure layer service implementing domain contract
@Injectable()
export class DeviceService implements IDeviceService {
  constructor(private readonly apiClient: DevicesApiService) {}
  
  async getDevices(): Promise<Device[]> {
    const dtos = await this.apiClient.getDevices();
    return DeviceMapper.toDomainModels(dtos);
  }
}

// ❌ Never import API client directly in application or presentation layers
import { DevicesApiService } from '@teensyrom-nx/data-access/api-client'; // BAD
```

### Testing Standards

- **Domain Testing**: Pure unit tests with no mocks (test business logic directly)
- **Application Testing**: Mock domain contracts to test use case orchestration
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Integration tests with MSW (Mock Service Worker) for HTTP
- **E2E Testing**: Cypress for complete user workflows across all layers

### UI Component Usage Patterns

- **Feature Components**: Smart components in `libs/features/*` use application state and coordinate business logic
- **UI Components**: Dumb components in `libs/ui/components` are purely presentational with no dependencies on business logic
- **Composition**: Feature components compose UI components, passing data down and events up
- **Theme Integration**: All components use the theme service and design tokens for consistent styling
- **Import Boundaries**: UI components never import from domain, application, or infrastructure layers

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
// ❌ Bad - UI component importing business logic
import { DeviceService } from '@teensyrom-nx/infrastructure';

// ✅ Good - UI component only imports other UI components and Angular
import { ActionButtonComponent } from '@teensyrom-nx/ui/components';

// ✅ Good - Feature component coordinates business logic
import { DeviceStore } from '@teensyrom-nx/application';
import { ActionButtonComponent } from '@teensyrom-nx/ui/components';

### Code Organization Standards

- **Layered Structure**: Clear physical separation of domain, application, infrastructure layers
- **UI Separation**: Pure presentational components separated from business logic
- **Barrel Exports**: Clean public APIs for all libraries via `index.ts`
- **Consistent Naming**: `.contract.ts`, `.service.ts`, `.mapper.ts`, `.models.ts`, `.component.ts` conventions
- **Import Rules**: Enforce dependency directions with linting rules (inner layers only, UI components stay pure)
- **Documentation**: Architecture decision records and layer-specific documentation
