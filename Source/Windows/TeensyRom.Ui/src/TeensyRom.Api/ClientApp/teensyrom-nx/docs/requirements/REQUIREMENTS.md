---

## Goals

- Provide a scalable, modular structure for an Angular app that interacts with TeensyROM devices.
- Centralize application and user preferences in a global settings store.
- Coordinate bootstrapping logic (e.g. auto-connect devices on startup).
- Use a shared generated API client library based on OpenAPI.
- Keep services domain-specific and state reactive and isolated.
- Maintain application-wide storage metadata state, including file launch history.

---

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. App Bootstrap

- Boot logic that runs on app startup.
- Reads app settings (e.g. auto-connect toggle).
- Initiates device discovery and connection.
- Sets initial application state.

### 2. Settings

- Covers both application-level configuration and user preferences.
- Stored in `settings-store`, updated via `settings.service.ts`.
- Can be persisted to local storage or synced to a backend.
- Loaded by `AppBootstrapService` during startup.

### 3. Device Services

- Perform backend API calls to discover, connect, and manage TeensyROM devices.
- Isolated in `services/device`, consuming the generated API client.
- Each device can have multiple associated storage types (SD and USB).

### 4. Storage Services

- Operate independently from the device service domain.
- Accessed via `(deviceId, storageType)` pair.
- Responsible for file metadata, directory structures, indexing, and file launch logic.
- Encapsulation improves maintainability and isolates storage concerns from device connectivity.

### 5. Application State

- `device-store` manages state about all connected/available devices.
- `settings-store` manages global configuration and preferences.
- `storage-store` maintains directory and file metadata per connected device and per storage type (SD or USB).
  - Includes most recently launched files, cached directory indexes, or file filtering state.
- Reactive approach (Signals or RxJS) for change propagation.

### 6. API Client

- Located in `libs/api-client`, generated using OpenAPI generator CLI.
- Consumed by services only (not directly by components).
